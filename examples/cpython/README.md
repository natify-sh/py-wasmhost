# CPython on `wasmhost.wasi.preview1`

The official CPython 3.15 (`python/cpython`, branch `3.15`, commit `1c6794e`), built for `wasm32-wasip1` with the build that CPython
ships (`Platforms/WASI`) and wasi-sdk 33, run by `wasmhost.wasi.preview1`. Not Pyodide: no Emscripten, no JavaScript glue, the WASI
interface only, so it runs on every backend that runs a WASI command.

```sh
python examples/cpython/run.py -c "print(1 + 1)"
python examples/cpython/run.py script.py                              # a file in the current folder
python examples/cpython/run.py --dir ~/data:/data -c "print(open('/data/a.txt').read())"
python examples/cpython/run.py --site ~/packages -c "import six"      # packages of pure Python, put on sys.path
```

`run.py` is only a convenience: `python.wasm` is a plain WASI command (`_start`, imports of `wasi_snapshot_preview1` only), so the
command of the package runs it too, if it is told where the standard library is:

```sh
python -m wasmhost run --dir examples/cpython::/py --env PYTHONHOME=/py --argv0 /py/python.wasm \
    examples/cpython/python.wasm -- -c "import sys; print(sys.platform)"
```

(Checked on Node. There is no current folder in that program: give one with another `--dir HOST::/`, and `--dir HOST::/site` with
`PYTHONPATH=/site` for packages.)

| `python.wasm`       | CPython with zlib linked in, 7.9 MB (the debug information is stripped)                            |
| `lib/python315.zip` | the standard library as byte code, 5 MB, found by CPython on its own                               |
| `sitecustomize.py`  | what WASI lacks (see below); `mkstdlib.py` puts it into the zip                                    |
| `run.py`            | the runner: `Preview1` with the current folder as `/` and this folder as `/py`                     |
| `python2.wasm`      | the same CPython for `wasm32-wasip2`: the core module of the component, 8 MB, run by `run2.py` (`Preview2`)                         |
| `run2.py`           | as `run.py` on `Preview2` (`--dir`, `-S` as `wasmhost run`); the exit code is 0 or 1 only                                           |
| `build_wasip2.sh`   | makes `python2.wasm` (wasi-sdk 34, no patch, `wasm-tools component unbundle`); not run in this change                              |
| `build.sh`          | makes `python.wasm` and `lib/python315.zip` from python/cpython, wasi-sdk and zlib                  |
| `mkstdlib.py`       | packs the standard library of a checkout into the zip                                              |

`run.py` options: `--dir HOST[:GUEST]` gives the program one more folder; `--site HOST` is a folder of packages, which becomes
`/site` (then `/site1`...) on `sys.path`. Everything else is passed to `python.wasm` (`-c`, `-m`, a script).

## WASI 0.2 (`run2.py`, `python2.wasm`)

The same commit built for `wasm32-wasip2` with no patch to CPython, unbundled to one core module (115 imports, all `wasi:*@0.2.12`) and run by `Preview2` with
the standard library of `lib/python315.zip`: `python examples/cpython/run2.py -c "print(1 + 1)"`. Run by hand on wasmtime, wasm3 and Node, and by
`tests/test_cpython_wasip2_example.py` on wasmtime, wasm3, Node and Bun; CI runs the small program on wasmtime (Linux x64; green on `b50b8aa`, 2026-11-05). The exit code is only 0 or 1:
CPython's `main` returns 3 for `sys.exit(3)` and the export `wasi:cli/run#run` turns any non-zero into err (the interface, not a defect). **The network is open by default in `run2.py`** (the library and `wasmhost run` deny it; `-S inherit-network=n,allow-ip-name-lookup=n` closes it here), and `--env NAME=VALUE` sets a variable. By hand on wasmtime (Linux): `pip` (26.3, its wheel put on `PYTHONPATH`, with `--env HOME=...`) installs a pure-Python wheel from a folder (`--no-index --find-links`) and from a plain-http index of a local `http.server` (the server saw the requests; without the network flag pip found nothing). This build has no `ssl` (`_ssl` is not built: pip says "Disabling truststore since ssl support is missing"), so no https. Not verified: https, stdin, another CPython commit, bun/jsc/jscontext/pyodide for the program itself. A note: on Bun two runs of this module that use sockets in one test killed the Bun process (status -11) three times in a row; the two tests were split and pass; not investigated. It is the same kind as the Bun 1.4.2 crashes already in BACKLOG (B-512: a segmentation fault in `git-real.wasm` on `git checkout`; `wasmclang.py`: Bun aborts while it compiles a large module, "a bug in Bun"): a large module and Bun's own crash, which makes it likely the same family, but this was not shown to be the same fault.
`build_wasip2.sh` was written from the recipe that made the committed module and **has not been run in this change**; its wasi-sdk checksum is known for Linux x86_64 only.

## Building

`./build.sh` needs git, curl, tar, make, a C compiler and python3. It downloads wasi-sdk 33 (checked against a SHA-256), fetches
CPython and zlib by commit, builds a native Python (the cross build needs one), cross-compiles, strips the module and packs the
standard library. Sources go to `./.build` (or `$WORK`), which is not committed. Nothing has to run WebAssembly while it builds, so
there is no wasmtime step. The committed `python.wasm` and `lib/python315.zip` are the output of it; another machine gives the same
contents but not necessarily the same bytes (paths are in the module, and the zip differed by a few bytes between two builds).

wasi-sdk has no zlib, so `build.sh` compiles the dozen C files of zlib 1.3.1 by hand and links them in. The arguments that say where
it is go to the WASI build only: the native Python is built without them.

## Checked

Run by hand on the Node and Bun backends of this repository (Linux x64). `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs a small program (`sys.platform`,
`json`, `re`, `hashlib`, a loop) on **wasmtime** (Linux x64) and on **`jscontext`** (a real `JSContext` through rubicon-objc, macOS);
both passed on the commit that added them (`de02bc6`). The checks below were made on Node; only that program has run on wasmtime and
`jscontext`, so `pip` and `asyncio` there are not checked.

`sitecustomize.py` makes up three things that WASI does not have and that `pip` imports: `os.getuid` and its relatives (always 0),
`os.umask`, and a `mmap` module that can be imported and cannot be used. It also takes the self-pipe out of `asyncio`'s selector loop
(there is no `socketpair`, and no thread or signal to wake the loop from), when `asyncio` is imported. Names that WASI does have are
left alone.

## Does not work

| What                                                     | Why                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network: `socket`, `urllib`, `requests`, `pip install` from an index | WASI preview1 has no sockets. `import socket` passes; `socket.socket()` and `getaddrinfo` fail. Downloads have to be done by the host (`pip download`).   |
| `ssl`, HTTPS                                             | no OpenSSL in the build (`_ssl` is missing)                                                                                                               |
| `subprocess`, `multiprocessing`, `ensurepip`, `venv.create(with_pip=True)` | `OSError: wasi does not support processes`. `ensurepip` runs `pip` in a child process; `get-pip.py` and `python -m pip` run it in the same one.          |
| `threading.Thread`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`                 | no threads: the build is `--disable-wasm-pthreads` (`RuntimeError: can't start new thread`)                                                                |
| Extension modules, wheels with compiled code             | no `dlopen`: a module must be linked into `python.wasm`. The `wasm32` wheels on PyPI (for example `py-ballisticcalc.exts`) are `pyemscripten_*`, built for Pyodide, not for WASI; no wheel tagged for WASI was found there. |
| `sqlite3`, `bz2`, `lzma`                                 | wasi-sdk has no such libraries (zlib was built by hand; these were not)                                                                                    |
| `zoneinfo` without `tzdata`                              | no time zone database; the pure Python `tzdata` wheel, given with `--site`, should do (not tried)                                                           |
| `ctypes`, `readline`, `tkinter`                          | not built for WASI                                                                                                                                         |

## Not done

- **An interactive prompt.** `input()` at a prompt works differently on iOS (keys do not work as in a terminal), as in the other
  examples of this repository; left for later.
- **The network.** Deliberately not built here. A bridge through the host Python is possible (a host function is a plain Python
  callable and works the same on every backend, the way `examples/git/` gets the network for libgit2), but it would be a second
  Pyodide-like layer on top of CPython: a `socket` and an `ssl` made up in Python, and a way in for the program (a C module in
  `python.wasm`, or names under a folder that the host answers). The plan is to wait for CPython to support WASI properly instead:
  WASI 0.2 has `wasi:sockets` (TCP, UDP, name lookup) and 0.3 adds async. That is TCP only, so HTTPS still needs TLS in the program
  (`ssl`) or a WASI interface for it, and `wasmhost` would need a preview2 host (the Component Model), which only some backends can
  run. Until then the host does the downloading (`pip download`) and the program installs from a folder.
- **Compiled extensions** linked into `python.wasm` (for example the C part of `py-ballisticcalc`).
- **`sqlite3`, `bz2`, `lzma`.**
- **Start time** was measured only on Node: about 1 s for `python -c pass`, 0.7 s of it compiling the module. On `jscontext` (no JIT on
  iOS) it is not measured.
- Not run on a device (Pythonista); on `jscontext` through rubicon only the small CI program has run.
