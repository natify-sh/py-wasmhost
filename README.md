# wasmhost

WebAssembly from **CPython, PyPy and Pythonista**, with the JavaScript WebAssembly API: modules, instances, memory,
globals, and host functions (Python callables the module calls). It runs on whichever backend is available:
JavaScriptCore's `JSContext` in Pythonista on iOS, JavaScriptCore, Node or Bun on a computer, or, when installed,
wasmtime or wasm3. Plain Python, no C extension of its own; its one dependency, [fusedwasi](https://github.com/natify-sh/fusedwasi), is pure Python too (it is the WASI host).

```python
import wasmhost

module = wasmhost.Module(open("lib.wasm", "rb").read())  # WebAssembly.Module
instance = wasmhost.Instance(module)  # WebAssembly.Instance
print(instance.exports.add(2, 3))  # i32/i64 -> int, f32/f64 -> float
instance.exports.memory.write(ptr, b"data")  # WebAssembly.Memory
print(instance.exports.counter.value)  # WebAssembly.Global
```

A module that imports functions gets them from the import object, a dict of dicts of Python callables, as in the
JavaScript API:

```python
def log(x):  # env.log(i32), which the module calls
    print("the module says", x)


instance = wasmhost.Instance(module, {"env": {"log": log}})
instance.exports.run()  # runs the module, which calls log
```

See [Host functions](#host-functions) below, `examples/basic.py` and `examples/imports.py`, and for something bigger,
both in a bare JavaScript engine:

- `examples/pyodide.py`: a Python REPL that runs in [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) (CPython built to WebAssembly),
  with a memory snapshot per backend, `fetch` served by Python and packages kept between sessions. It started as a
  [gist](https://gist.github.com/o-murphy/dd898e490094eaddab0875187e27f11a) for a Pythonista `JSContext`.
- `examples/jslinux.py`: a Linux virtual machine (JSLinux, riscv64 or x86_64 Alpine), with its console on your
  terminal.

`examples/cpython/` runs the official CPython (3.15, built to `wasm32-wasip1` with wasi-sdk, not Pyodide) on `wasmhost.wasi.preview1`:
`python.wasm` and its standard library are committed, `build.sh` makes them from python/cpython, and `run.py` runs them
(`python examples/cpython/run.py -c "print(1)"`). No processes, sockets or `dlopen` there, as WASI preview1 has none.

Both keep their downloads in `$WASMHOST_CACHE`, else `~/.cache/wasmhost`, else `./.cache` where there is no usable
home directory (PythonIDE).

`examples/wasmclang.py` compiles C and C++ to WebAssembly with clang and lld that are themselves WebAssembly (the wasm-clang
project), with Python as their WASI host, and runs the result, with no compiler installed and no process started, so
it works in Pythonista.

`examples/coreutils.py` is a small shell over uutils coreutils (Rust, built to WASI, in `examples/wasm/`): `ls`, `cat`,
`sort`, `cp`, `seq`, `wc` and the rest, and `lua`, with pipes and redirects, over a directory of the real file system.
The WASI host for the modules is `wasmhost.wasi.preview1` (see [WASI](#wasi)); the example only gives it a directory and a limit on what a
pipe may carry. `wasmclang.py` takes the calls that are not about files from `wasi.preview1` and leaves the file calls to `memfs.wasm`, a file system that is
itself a WebAssembly module; `wasi_sh.py` keeps a host of its own (a file system in a Python dict, pipes and hooks), because `wasi.preview1` is the
specification's calls over real folders and nothing more.

`examples/wasi_sh.py` is a real POSIX shell, BusyBox `ash` with about fifty utilities (the wasi-sh project's
`busybox.wasm`, downloaded once from npm), with pipes, `$(...)`, here-documents and functions, over a file system that is
a Python dict: nothing real is touched. It is made for Pythonista (`input()` at the prompt, no terminal needed).

`examples/git/` is a whole git client for Pythonista (StaSh's `git clone`, `commit`, `merge`, `push`, ...): git itself and libgit2
built to WASI with `zig cc`, with Python as their WASI host; libgit2 does the network (http and https), served by the host
through four imports, because WASI preview1 has no sockets. See [examples/git/README.md](examples/git/README.md).

`examples/coremark.py` runs CoreMark (the wasm3 project's build, in `examples/wasm/`) on every backend that starts here,
to compare their speed. A runtime that finishes the last pass in under 10 s is not scored by CoreMark itself, so it
prints the pass time too.

- **Types.** The JavaScript API can't tell a function's signature, and it matters (an `i64` argument must reach
  JavaScript as a BigInt), so the binary's type, import, function, global and export sections are read in
  Python. `Module.exports(module)` and `Module.imports(module)` describe a module with them, and
  `Module.customSections(module, name)` gives the contents of its custom sections (a list of `bytes`).
- **Errors** are the API's: `CompileError`, `LinkError` and `Trap` (`WebAssembly.RuntimeError`, which is also a
  `RuntimeError`); an out-of-bounds memory access is an `IndexError`.
- **Memory** is copied, not shared: `memory.read(offset, n)`, `memory.write(offset, data)`, `memory[a:b]`,
  `memory.grow(pages)`.

## Installation

### uv

```shell
uv add wasmhost

# With wasmtime, the in-process JIT (otherwise Node, Bun or WebKitGTK JavaScriptCore is used)
uv add wasmhost[wasmtime]
```

### pip

```shell
pip install wasmhost

# With wasmtime, the in-process JIT (otherwise Node, Bun or WebKitGTK JavaScriptCore is used)
pip install wasmhost[wasmtime]
```

The `wasm3` backend has no extra: pywasm3's PyPI release is years behind the API used here, so install it from git
(CPython 3.11+, needs a C compiler): `pip install "pywasm3 @ git+https://github.com/wasm3/pywasm3"`.

### Pyodide

The ordinary wheel (pure Python, `py3-none-any`) installs with `micropip`, and the `pyodide` backend is the only one that
starts there, so nothing is configured (see [Pyodide as a backend](#pyodide-as-a-backend) for what it can and can not do).

From the Pyodide REPL, or any Python that runs in Pyodide:

```python
import micropip

await micropip.install("wasmhost")

import wasmhost

print(wasmhost.get_backend().name)  # pyodide
wasmhost.selftest()  # the same self-test as anywhere else
```

From JavaScript, in a browser or in Node (`npm install pyodide`):

```js
import { loadPyodide } from "pyodide";

const py = await loadPyodide();
await py.loadPackage("micropip");
await py.runPythonAsync(`
import micropip
await micropip.install("wasmhost")

import wasmhost
print(wasmhost.get_backend().name)  # pyodide
wasmhost.selftest()
`);
```

A wheel built from a checkout (`uv build --wheel`) installs from its path or URL, e.g. `await micropip.install("emfs:/wheels/wasmhost-...-py3-none-any.whl")`,
after putting the file in Pyodide's file system (`py.FS.writeFile`, or `mountNodeFS` on Node). In the repository itself,
`node tests/pyodide_run.mjs selftest` and `pytest` run the self-test and the suite inside Pyodide.

### Pythonista and PythonIDE (iOS)

The ordinary wheel: it is pure Python (`py3-none-any`). In StaSh (Pythonista) or PythonIDE's pip,
`pip install wasmhost`, then run the self-test (see [Try it on a device](#try-it-on-a-device)).

### iSH and iSH-AOK (iOS)

iSH is a Linux shell for iOS (an emulated Linux with ordinary CPython); iSH-AOK is a fork of it. Neither has `objc_util`,
JavaScriptCore or Node, so without an engine the self-test ends with `no backend could start` and says what to install.

- **iSH-AOK** (`Linux 5.10.0-ish_aok`, `aarch64`): `wasmtime` installs there and works, and so does `wasm3` (`WASMHOST_BACKEND=wasm3`),
  both 34/34.

  ```shell
  uv tool install wasmhost --with wasmtime
  wasmhost self test
  ```
- **The original iSH** (`Linux 4.20.69-ish`, `i686`): the owner ran it with `wasm3` only. It passes 31 of 34
  steps; the three that fail all come from one thing, see "On the original iSH, `wasm3` starts a memory at its maximum" in
  [Backends](#backends).

Both were run by the owner, not by the assistant: see [Where it has been run](#where-it-has-been-run).

## Host functions

`Instance(module, imports)` takes the import object for the module's function imports (`Module.imports(module)`
lists them with their types). A callable gets its arguments as `int` (`i32`, `i64`) and `float` (`f32`, `f64`) and
returns what the signature says: `None`, one value, or a tuple for several results. What it returns is checked (an
`int` for an integer result, a number for a float one) and a wrong answer is a `TypeError`.

- **An exception** raised in a host function comes out of the call into the module that led to it, as the same
  exception, and the instance is still usable. That holds on every backend.
- **A host function can call the module again** (`instance.exports.f(...)` from inside it), and its own errors come
  out of the outer call.
- **Errors in the import object** are the API's: a missing module is a `TypeError`, a missing or non-callable
  function a `LinkError`. A global, a memory and a table go into the same import object (see below). A backend that
  can't take host functions says so (`backend.supports("imports")`), and one that can't take the others says so
  with `import.global`, `import.memory` and `import.table`.

How a host function is called depends on the backend: `wasmtime` and `wasm3` call the Python function themselves; the
JavaScript engines that are JavaScriptCore (`jsc`, and `jscontext` on iOS) do it through its C API, which makes a
JavaScript function that calls Python; Node and Bun write a request on their pipe and waits for the answer, reading its
stdin synchronously. Only `gi-jsc` can't: PyGObject has no way to make a JavaScript function that calls Python.

## Globals

`Global(type, value, mutable=False)` makes a `WebAssembly.Global` on its own (or, as in JavaScript,
`Global({"value": "i32", "mutable": True}, 7)`), and an instance can import it, one instance or several:

```python
counter = wasmhost.Global("i32", 0, mutable=True)
a = wasmhost.Instance(module, {"env": {"counter": counter}})
b = wasmhost.Instance(module, {"env": {"counter": counter}})  # the same global: what one writes, the other reads
counter.value = 10  # and so does the host
```

An exported global (`instance.exports.g`) can be passed to another instance the same way, and for an immutable one a
plain number is enough (`{"env": {"limit": 100}}`), as in the JavaScript API. A wrong import (a number for a mutable
global, another type, another backend) is a `LinkError`; an immutable global's `value` can't be written (`TypeError`).
`backend.supports("import.global")` says whether a backend can (`wasm3` can't: pywasm3 makes no global outside a
module). A global has to be as mutable as the module says (`LinkError` otherwise), as in JavaScript.

## Memories and tables

`Memory(initial, maximum=None)` (in 64 KiB pages) and `Table("funcref", initial, maximum=None)` make a
`WebAssembly.Memory` and `WebAssembly.Table` on their own, to import into one instance or several (an Emscripten build
imports its memory). As in JavaScript they also take a descriptor, `Memory({"initial": 1, "maximum": 16})` and
`Table({"element": "anyfunc", "initial": 2})`:

```python
mem = wasmhost.Memory(1, 16)
a = wasmhost.Instance(module, {"env": {"memory": mem}})
mem.write(0, b"shared with every instance that imports it")

table = wasmhost.Table("funcref", 2)
user = wasmhost.Instance(module, {"env": {"table": table}})
table.set(0, provider.exports.add)  # a Function (or None to empty the entry)
table.get(0) is provider.exports.add  # True: one function is one object, as in JavaScript
table.get(0).type()  # FuncType((i32, i32), (i32,)); wasmtime finds it, a JavaScript engine does not tell:
# there a function an `elem` segment put in the table is known, any other: a `ValueError` and `table.get(0).signature = FuncType((i32, i32), (i32,))` (a call looks for it, too);
# a wrong signature given by hand is a `TypeError` when called (the engine checks the type), never a wrong result
table.grow(2)  # the length before
wasmhost.Table(
    "funcref", 2, 4, provider.exports.add
)  # every entry starts as `add`; table.grow(1, f) adds entries of `f`
```

An import that is not the right object, is too small for the module or comes from another backend is a `LinkError`.
Only `funcref` tables are supported (no `externref`). `wasm3` has neither (pywasm3 imports functions only:
`NotImplementedError`).

Like the JavaScript API, all the instances of a backend live in one store, so nothing stops two of them from sharing
what the host made. **`isolated=True` is not in the JavaScript API**: `Instance(module, isolated=True)` gives an
instance a store of its own, which goes away with it. It matters on `wasmtime`, which never frees an instance's memory
inside a store (only when the store is dropped): the default is one store per backend, freed by `wasmhost.close()`,
so many instances add up (300 instances of 1 MiB were 315 MB, not given back by `store.gc()`), while an isolated one
is freed when the instance is. Its price: it shares nothing (a Global made outside it is a `ValueError`).
`backend.supports("isolated")` is true for `wasmtime` and `wasm3` (a `wasm3` instance is isolated anyway); on the
JavaScript engines, which have one store, it is a `NotImplementedError`.

## Types

`type()` is the type reflection of the JavaScript API, with its names, on a function, a memory, a table and a global
(on every backend: the types are read from the module's binary, not asked of the engine, which may not have them):

```python
instance.exports.add.type()  # FuncType(parameters=('i32', 'i32'), results=('i32',))
instance.exports.memory.type()  # MemoryType(minimum=1, maximum=4, shared=False)
instance.exports.table.type()  # TableType(element='funcref', minimum=2, maximum=None)
instance.exports.counter.type()  # GlobalType(value='i32', mutable=True)
```

`Module.imports()` and `Module.exports()` give the same types in the `type` of each entry, so what a module asks
for (the limits of an imported memory or table, whether a global is mutable) can be read before it is instantiated.
What `type()` gives goes back into the constructor: `Memory(memory.type())`.

Value types are `wasmhost.i32`, `i64`, `f32` and `f64`. They are `str`s (`i32 == "i32"`), so a name does wherever one
of them goes: `FuncType((i32, i32), (i32,))` and `FuncType(("i32", "i32"), ("i32",))` are the same. An `i64` is an
`int` here, as every integer type is; it is what JavaScript takes as a `BigInt`.

`minimum` is the size now, as the specification has it (a table's `minimum` in JavaScriptCore is too; its memory's
stays the initial size). A shared memory is refused (`NotImplementedError`): there are no threads here.

## Async and threads

`await wasmhost.compile(bytes)` and `await wasmhost.instantiate(bytes | module, imports)` are the JavaScript API's promises
(`instantiate` of bytes gives `Instantiated(module, instance)`, of a `Module` just the `Instance`). The synchronous
`Module(...)`, `Instance(...)` and `instantiate_sync(...)` stay. By default the work is done in place with a turn of the
event loop before and after it, and uses **no threads**, so it works where Python's threads do not. `threaded=True` does it in a
worker thread on `wasmtime`, `node` and `bun`, which keeps the loop free during a long compile (the JavaScriptCore backends
and `wasm3` are tied to their thread and always run in place).

A backend takes one call at a time: every call into it holds a lock of the backend's own (reentrant, so a host function
may call back into the same backend), and two backends never wait for each other. Several tasks or threads may use one
backend, one after the other; to run two engines side by side make two backends (`wasmhost.NodeBackend()` twice), the
default one is shared. A host function must not wait for another thread that wants the same backend.

## Batches

On a JavaScript engine every call into it has a fixed cost (a pipe to `node`, a bridged Objective-C call in
Pythonista). A batch does several steps in one trip (on `wasmtime` and `wasm3`, in Python), and a step can use the results of the earlier ones:

```python
batch = instance.batch()
ptr = batch.call(instance.exports.alloc, len(data))  # a Ref
batch.write(instance.exports.memory, ptr, data)
status = batch.call(instance.exports.run, ptr)
batch.stop_if_nonzero(status)  # leave the rest out on an error status
out = batch.read(instance.exports.memory, ptr, 16)
batch.run()
out.value  # bytes (`.done` says whether the step ran)
```

A function with several results gives a tuple of `Ref`s (`low, high = batch.call(split, x)`), each usable by later steps.
A failing step (a trap, an out-of-bounds access) raises from `run()`, after the earlier steps' results are set.
Only `i32` results can be used in arithmetic (`ptr * 8`, `ptr + 4`).

## Bytes in and out of a JavaScript engine

A program with JavaScript of its own (Pyodide, an emulator) needs to hand the engine files and read results back.
`JSBackend.put_bytes(target, data)` assigns a `Uint8Array` to a JavaScript expression (`__files["a"]`), and
`JSBackend.get_bytes(expr)` returns the bytes of one. On the JavaScriptCore backends (`jsc`, and `jscontext` under
`objc_util`) through its C API (`ctypes`), which fills the array in place; through hex on the others and as the
fallback if the C API ever fails. The self-test reports which was used (`N bytes via C API` or `via hex`).

## Big buffers on Node and Bun

`Memory.read` and `Memory.write` of 16 KiB or more do not go over the pipe to `node` or `bun` (base64 in a JSON line, about 50 MB/s) but
through a file: Python writes it, Node reads it straight into the memory of the module, or the other way round, and only a short line
crosses the pipe. The file is in a private directory (mode 0700, `/dev/shm` where there is one, else the temporary directory) that goes with
the backend, and a script in the engine can reach that one file only. About 1.5 to 2.5 GB/s from a 1 MiB buffer (`wasmhost bench --buffer 1024`),
against 50 to 100 MB/s before; below 16 KiB the pipe is as quick. If the directory cannot be made the pipe carries everything, as before.
Batches (`Batch.read` / `Batch.write`) and `put_bytes` / `get_bytes` still use the pipe. `wasmtime` is faster still, and is first in the order.

It is JavaScriptCore (as in Safari and on iOS) in a runtime of its own, and runs the very script `node` does                                                                                                                                       |

| `pyodide`   | inside [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) (CPython in WebAssembly: a browser or Node) | `import js`; it calls the `WebAssembly` of the engine around Python directly (no `pip install`: Pyodide is not on PyPI, see [Pyodide](#pyodide-as-a-backend))                                                                                                       |

With nothing configured, the first backend that starts wins, in the order shown, which is by speed (a JIT before an interpreter), then by how much of WebAssembly the runtime runs, then by what it costs to run: `wasmtime`, `node`, `bun`, `jsc`, `gi-jsc`, then the interpreters `wasm3` and `jscontext`, and `pyodide` last. (On Pythonista nothing above `jscontext` can be installed, so it is the pick there.) Each backend's constructor is its
own probe: it fails when its runtime is missing. Choose one with `WASMHOST_BACKEND=<name>` (or `--runtime <name>`, the same as `--backend <name>`, in `run`, `bench` and `self test`; the option wins over the variable),
`wasmhost.set_backend("<name>")` or `Module(..., backend="<name>")`; `wasmhost.get_backend().name` says which is in
use. `wasmhost.close()` closes the backends it started. (In WebAssembly's words the *host* is the embedder, the
Python side that provides imports; what runs the module is the backend.)

Not every backend can do everything; `backend.supports(...)` says:

**`wasm3` has room for 128 live instances in a process.** Its guarded memory hands out slots of one arena, a module loaded takes
one and a runtime freed gives it back, so the 129th instance alive at once is `RuntimeError: memory allocation failed` (measured,
and the same whether the module has a memory or not). An `Instance` is in a reference cycle (it holds its exports, which hold it), so
one is freed only when Python's cyclic collector gets to it: in a loop that makes many of them, on a build whose collector runs rarely
(the free-threaded `3.14t` did, in CI), call `gc.collect()` now and then, or keep them few. The other backends have no such limit.

**On the original iSH, `wasm3` starts a memory at its maximum.** On the original iSH (`i686`, CPython 3.11.12) a module whose memory
is declared as 1 page, at most 4, is 4 pages long from the start: `len(memory)` is 262144, `type()` says `minimum=4`, and the
module's own `memory.grow(1)` answers -1 (it is already at its maximum). The same module has 1 page on 64-bit (Linux x86-64, and
`wasm3` on iSH-AOK, `aarch64`: 34/34 there). Three steps of the self-test fail for this reason (`module's own memory.grow`,
`Instance(max_memory=)` and `type()` of a memory); the other 31 pass. That is what was observed. The cause is not known and has not been looked into: the owner suspects iSH's emulation of i386 rather than 32-bit as such. Tried to reproduce it on 2026-10-08 and could not: `wasm3` as `pywasm3` pins it (`21f029a`, with `pywasm3`'s own compile flags) built as 32-bit x86 against glibc and against musl 1.2.5 (the C library of the iSH wheels), on a real x86-64 kernel, loads a 1..4 page memory as 1 page and `coremark-minimal.wasm` (2 pages, no maximum, data up to 67 657 bytes) as 2 pages. So neither 32 bits nor musl is the cause; what is left is iSH's emulator, or the `wasm3` inside the owner's wheel (`0.9.1.dev76+g7562b12f`, the pin is `dev75`). It is the only platform so far where not every test passes.

**PyGObject for `gi-jsc`.** The simplest way is the system's own `python3-gi` (with `gir1.2-javascriptcoregtk-4.1`) and the system's Python, as
CI does. To have it in a venv instead, `pip install "wasmhost[gi-jsc]"` (or `uv sync --extra gi-jsc`) builds PyGObject from source, so the system needs
its development files first, and which ones depends on the PyGObject that gets built: **3.52 and later need `girepository-2.0`** (GLib 2.80+: Ubuntu 24.04
and later), **3.50 and earlier need `girepository-1.0`**:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04 and later (PyGObject 3.52+, the default)
sudo apt install libgirepository-2.0-dev gir1.2-javascriptcoregtk-4.1 libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev build-essential

# an older Ubuntu (22.04): the older development package, and keep PyGObject below 3.52
sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-javascriptcoregtk-4.1 libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev build-essential
pip install "wasmhost[gi-jsc]" "pygobject<3.52"
```

The build stops with `Dependency 'girepository-2.0' is required but not found` when only the older package is there (seen on Ubuntu 26.04, where
`libgirepository1.0-dev` alone was not enough for PyGObject 3.58). The backend asks for the `4.1` typelib of JavaScriptCore, so on a system that only
has `4.0` it does not start: use `jsc`, which needs no PyGObject. The Ubuntu 22.04 line was not tried here.

**No JIT on iOS.** In Pythonista (and any app that is not Safari) JavaScriptCore runs WebAssembly without its JIT, so `jscontext` there is
an interpreter: `python -m wasmhost bench` shows a loop several times slower than `jsc` on a desktop and close to `jsc --no-jit`.
For plain computation an interpreter such as `wasm3` would be faster there, but `wasm3` is a C extension that can not be installed
on iOS; the cost of a call from Python is the same either way (the bridge dominates).

**Deno is not supported.** Run on its pipe protocol like Node, it passes all of the self-test but the exception-handling step: Deno
(2.9.6 and 2.9.7 tried) panics ("Deno has panicked", `capacity overflow`) when a `WebAssembly.Exception` leaves
`vm.runInContext`, which is what a module that throws an exception of a tag the caller does not catch does there. Node
and Bun are the same V8 and JavaScriptCore without this. It is an upstream bug; see `BACKLOG.md` (B-701b).

### Pyodide as a backend

wasmhost can also run *inside* Pyodide, and then the backend is the `WebAssembly` object of the JavaScript engine that Pyodide
runs in, called through Pyodide's `js` module, with no source text evaluated and no process started. Load the package into
Pyodide (`micropip.install` a wheel, or mount the source) and it is picked by itself, as nothing else can start there:

```python
import wasmhost  # in Pyodide

instance = wasmhost.Instance(wasmhost.Module(data))  # backend: pyodide
```

It takes host functions and globals, memories and tables made on their own and imported. It has no `timeout`, `fuel` or
`isolated` (`supports(...)` says so; Python has one thread there and nothing to stop a call with), and no `Memory.view`
(Pyodide copies a buffer when it makes a `memoryview`). Threads do not exist in Python on Emscripten, and the tests that need
them, symbolic links or the per-thread CPU clock are skipped there.

The self-test and the whole suite run in CI inside Pyodide on Node (`tests/pyodide_run.mjs`); to try it here:

```bash
npm install --global pyodide            # or `npm install pyodide` in the folder you run from
node tests/pyodide_run.mjs selftest     # python -m wasmhost self test --backend pyodide, inside Pyodide
node tests/pyodide_run.mjs pytest       # the suite on the pyodide backend (needs a network for pytest's wheel)
```

`--backend pyodide` on an ordinary Python only says "No module named 'js'", as expected.

### What has run where

`yes` means it has run: on the assistant's computer, in CI, or by the owner on a device. `no` means it fails. `n/a` means it cannot: `wasmtime`
and `wasm3` are not JavaScript engines, so the Pyodide example, which is JavaScript glue, does not apply to them, and `gi-jsc` takes no host
functions, so nothing that imports anything runs on it. `?` is not run or not looked at.

The first four CoreMark scores are from one x86-64 computer and the `jscontext` one from a phone without JIT, so they say an order of magnitude and
not more. `wasmclang.py` on Bun stops with `panic: abort() called` and Bun's own "this indicates a bug in Bun" (Bun 1.4.2, in the second build, the
WASI program); the file as it was before 2026-10-07 does the same. Pyodide's own `pyodide.asm.wasm` does not link on `wasm3` in any case: it imports
280 globals, which our `wasm3` backend can't give, and uses `externref`. `jslinux.py` needs a server that the assistant's environment cannot reach.

**Known problem: PyPy on macOS with the `jsc` backend.** On PyPy 3.11 (macOS, arm64) the `jsc` backend, the system JavaScriptCore through
`ctypes`, sometimes ends the process with a segmentation fault in `JSValueToStringCopy`. It happens when Python reads the memory of a
module from inside a host function that the module itself called (for example `fd_write` of a WASI program, as in `coreutils.py`), so
a run of the test suite hits it about once in ten to twenty-five repeats, with the JIT of JavaScriptCore on or off. It was not seen on
CPython on macOS, on PyPy on Linux (WebKitGTK's JavaScriptCore, 30 repeats), or with any other backend. The cause is not known; on macOS use
CPython for `jsc`, or another backend (`wasmtime`, `node`, `bun`) on PyPy. Details are in `BACKLOG.md`.

CoreMark built natively (C, `-O2`, not through wasmhost), as a baseline for the devices where iSH emulates the processor: **3169** (GCC 15.2.0, 60000
iterations, 18.9 s, "Correct operation validated") on iSH-AOK 1.3 (557), Linux 5.10.0-ish_aok aarch64; **1590** (GCC 12.2.1, 20000 iterations, 12.6 s,
also validated) on the original iSH, Linux 4.20.69-ish i686. Through wasmhost (`examples/coremark.py`, the wasm3 project's build of CoreMark) on iSH-AOK: `wasmtime` **2571.2** (the last pass 15.6 s) and `wasm3`
**207.2** (14.5 s; a `pywasm3` wheel built for musllinux aarch64), that is about 81 % and 6.5 % of the native 3169. The last pass is calibrated by each
runtime to take over 10 s, so its time says nothing about speed: the scores do. On the original iSH (i686) `wasm3` does not get as far as a score: `examples/coremark.py` stops with `failed: data segment out of bounds` (the owner's run, 2026-10-08; the same platform as the 3 failed memory steps of the self-test, cause not investigated). These numbers are not comparable with
the table's above either (another machine, another build of the benchmark).

## Limits for untrusted code

Three limits, each an extension outside the JavaScript API except the first road of the memory ceiling.
What an engine can't do is a `NotImplementedError` (`backend.supports("timeout")`, `supports("fuel")`), never a silent no-op.

| Backend                      | Memory ceiling | `timeout` | `fuel` |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------ |
| `wasmtime`                   | yes            | yes       | yes    |
| `wasm3`                      | yes            | yes       | yes    |
| `node`                       | yes            | yes       | no     |
| `bun`                        | yes            | no        | no     |
| `jsc`, `gi-jsc`, `jscontext` | yes            | no        | no     |

So **on iOS (`jscontext`) only the memory ceiling exists**: do not run untrusted code there expecting a time limit.

**Memory.** `memory.grow` past the ceiling answers `-1` and nothing else changes. A module that *imports* its memory
(Emscripten `IMPORTED_MEMORY`, `wasm-ld --import-memory`) is held as in JavaScript: give it `Memory(initial, maximum)` (not on
`wasm3`, which has no imported memory). A memory the module makes itself, with no maximum, is held by
`Instance(module, max_memory=pages)` (also in `instantiate` and `instantiate_sync`): the maximum is written into a copy of the
module, so it works the same on every engine, and the copy for a given ceiling is compiled once and kept.

**Time.** `Instance(module, timeout=seconds)` ends a call that runs longer with a `Timeout` (a `Trap`). It is wall-clock time,
per call (a batch is one call; the start function and host functions are under it too).

- `wasmtime`: by epochs. The instance gets an engine that counts them, a tight loop runs about 3 times slower, and it lives in a
  store of its own, so it can't share a `Memory`, `Table` or `Global` made outside it. The instance can be called again.
- `node`: `vm`'s timeout. A `Timeout` in a batch drops the results of the steps before it. The instance can be called again.
- `wasm3`: no thread can stop a call (it holds the GIL), so the call is cut into slices of gas (about 5 ms of a tight loop, about
  8% cost) and the clock is looked at between them, using pywasm3's suspendable runs. A paused call can't be cancelled, so
  **an instance that timed out is finished: every later call is a `Trap` that says so** (other instances, and a new one from the
  same module, are fine).
- `bun` (its `vm` timeout leaves a wasm loop running) and the JavaScriptCore ones (a script's time limit does not reach a wasm
  loop, checked with `JSContextGroupSetExecutionTimeLimit`): not possible.

**Fuel.** `Instance(module, fuel=n)` ends a call that uses more than `n` units with an `OutOfFuel` (a `Trap`). It is
deterministic, the same on every machine, and needs no thread. The unit is the engine's own (a turn of a tight loop is 8 on
`wasmtime`, under 0.1 on `wasm3`), so a number does not carry from one engine to the other. Each call starts with the whole
budget (a batch is one call; a call from a host function shares the outer one).

- `wasmtime`: `consume_fuel`. The instance gets an engine that counts fuel (a tight loop about 2.4 times slower) and a store of
  its own, like a timed one.
- `wasm3`: pywasm3's gas. A clean trap, and the instance goes on; with a `timeout` too it can't (the call is in slices), as after a
  `Timeout`.
- Node, Bun and the JavaScriptCore engines have nothing to count with.

`timeout` and `fuel` can be given together; whichever runs out first ends the call (on `wasmtime` that instance pays for both
engines, about 5 times slower on a tight loop).

## WASI

`wasmhost.wasi.preview1` is a host for `wasi_snapshot_preview1` (WASI 0.1), the interface that Rust (`wasm32-wasip1`), wasi-sdk, Zig and
most "command line" modules are built against: all 46 functions of the specification, in plain Python. The calls themselves are those of the package
`fusedwasi` (a dependency of wasmhost: pure Python, `py3-none-any`, nothing else to install; one `fusedwasi.p2.State` is the world of a `Preview1` and one `Guest` is each instance), the Python twin of the C core that `wasmext` builds into
its modules; the two are tested against each other with the same scripts of calls. `wasmhost.wasi.preview1` gives them the shape wasmhost has: the options below,
the import objects of the engines, and the tables of the specification. It also
offers `wasi_unstable`, the first snapshot, which older toolchains (wasienv, wasm-clang) still produce and which the Lua build of
`examples/coreutils.py` imports from. It is checked against the specification's own `witx` files of both snapshots (names, signatures,
the numbers of errors and flags, the layout of the records), and its self-test step runs a small WASI program of each on every backend.

It runs on the `pyodide` backend too (wasmhost inside Pyodide; the self-test step and the tests pass there; with fusedwasi as the host the self-test was run again, 35 of 35, and the whole suite is the CI job "Pyodide"), with what Emscripten
lacks: the files a program sees are Pyodide's virtual file system (on Node a real folder can be mounted with `mountNodeFS`), there are no
symbolic links (`path_symlink` and `path_readlink` fail). Python there has no per-thread CPU clock, so `thread_cputime_id` reads the process's CPU
clock, which is the same thing with one thread.

```python
import sys

    args=["prog", "-v"],
    env={"HOME": "/"},
    preopens={"/": "some/folder"},
    stdin=b"input",

```

- **Names.** `wasmhost.wasi` is a package with a module for each version of WASI: `preview1` is WASI 0.1, with the class `Preview1`,
  which the package exports too (`from wasmhost.wasi import Preview1`). A class has the version in its name, so a later `Wasip2`
  cannot be taken for it.
- **Folders.** `preopens` maps the name the program sees to a folder of the host; several can be given, and a name that leaves its
  folder (`..`, an absolute name, a link that points out) is refused with `ENOTCAPABLE`. On POSIX a name is walked from the folder one step at a time with `openat`, and a link met on the way is read and
  its target put in front of the rest of the name, so there is no gap between the check and the open (a name that passes through a folder that is not there
  is `ENOENT`, not `ENOTCAPABLE`: it is walked as it comes). On Windows there is no `openat`: a name is resolved by hand and checked against the real
  paths, and the check and the open are two steps, so another process changing the folder in between can still get past it.
- **Read-only.** `readonly=True` makes every preopen read-only, `readonly={"data"}` only the ones of those names. The rights that change
  something are taken away from the folder (and so from what is opened in it), so a call that would write, make, remove, rename or
  link answers `ENOTCAPABLE`, and a file opened with every right asked for is opened for reading only.
- **Streams.** `stdin` is bytes or an object with `read(n)` (default: empty, there is no interactive input); `stdout` and `stderr`
  are callables that take bytes, or objects with `write` (default: the interpreter's own streams).
- **Running.** `wasi.run(module)` instantiates, starts and closes. To give options to the instance, or to make it yourself, use
  `wasi.instantiate(module, timeout=5)` and `wasi.start(instance)`, or `wasi.imports()` with `wasi.bind(instance)`: the import
  object has both snapshots, and the engine links the one a module asks for. Each `imports()` is the calls of one more instance over
  the same world (the same files, arguments, environment and standard streams, and a memory of its own: `bind(instance)` gives it the
  memory of the instance whose import object came from the last `imports()`, and `instantiate` does the pairing by itself), so several
  instances can run over one `Preview1`. fusedwasi reads and writes the memory of the instance through a view where the engine gives one (wasmtime, wasm3) and otherwise through `read`/`write` of the range a call touches.
- **`wasi_unstable`** is the same calls with four differences (the order of `whence`, one right less, a 32-bit link count in
  `filestat`, and a clock subscription with an extra field) and no `sock_accept`.
- **Errors.** A read of standard output and a write to standard input are `EBADF`; a name that is not UTF-8 is `ENOENT` on POSIX (a name is bytes
  there) and `EINVAL` on Windows; unlinking a directory is `EISDIR` on Linux and `EPERM` on macOS (what the system says); a seek by 0 bytes from the current position needs only the right to tell. These are the answers of fusedwasi, and so of `wasmext`.
- **Not supported:** sockets (`ENOTSOCK`), signals (`ENOSYS`: `proc_raise` does not end the program here, whereas in `wasmext` it does; wasmhost gives fusedwasi a `signal` hook that answers `ENOSYS`, since without one fusedwasi answers `ENOTSUP`; signal 0, "none", is success (0) and a number above 30 `EINVAL`, both answered by fusedwasi itself). A host function that sleeps (`poll_oneoff`) is outside what
  `timeout` and `fuel` can stop.

## Try it on a device

The package carries a self-test, since nothing else can be run in Pythonista/Python IDE to see whether this works there:

```python
import wasmhost

wasmhost.selftest()  # or, from a shell: python -m wasmhost self test [--backend NAME] [--all]
```

It prints one line per check, then `N/M passed`: the Objective-C bridge in use (and, if the C API is not used, why:
`C API  not used: ...`), `WebAssembly` and `BigInt` in the engine, bytes in and out (`via C API` or `via hex`), calls,
`i64`, memory, globals, traps, batches, host functions, a WASI program, globals made on their own and shared between instances, an
isolated instance, which encodings of WebAssembly exceptions the engine takes (`final (try_table): yes, older
(try/catch): no`: a module built with C++ exceptions, such as bclibc's `bclibc_wasm.wasm` from wasi-sdk, needs the final one),
and the cost of a call. A check the backend can't do says so (`not available on this backend, as
documented`) and counts as passed. If something fails, send the whole output. On a computer,
`python -m wasmhost self test --all` runs it on every backend that starts. Installed with pip, the same commands are
there as `wasmhost self test` and `wasmhost bench`.

`wasmhost run [OPTIONS] module.wasm [-- ARGUMENTS]` runs a module along the lines of `wasmtime run` (the results, the exit codes and the options were compared with wasmtime 48.0.5; `--invoke` with too many words is an error here, and the `-W`/`-O`/... groups are not there). A module with `_start` is a WASI
command (`wasmhost.wasi.Preview1`) and its exit code is the command's; `--invoke FUNCTION` calls an exported function
instead, the words after the module being its arguments (`wasmhost run --invoke add m.wasm 2 3` prints `5`; one result
per line, a float as Rust prints it: `0.5`, `NaN`, `inf`). Options: `--backend`, `--dir HOST[::GUEST]` (repeatable),
`--readonly`, `--env NAME[=VALUE]`, `--inherit-env` (all the variables of the process; `--env` wins), `--argv0 NAME` (the default is the module's file name), `--max-memory PAGES`, `--timeout SECONDS`, `--fuel UNITS`. `--runtime NAME` is `--backend NAME`. A trap exits with 134, as in
wasmtime; any other error with 1. Everything after the module belongs to the program. Only the WASI functions are provided: a module that imports others (`examples/coremark.py`'s `env.clock_ms`) does not link, as in `wasmtime`; programs like that are run from Python, as the examples do.

`python -m wasmhost bench [--backend NAME] [--no-jit] [--buffer KIB]` times a call, a batch of three, moving a buffer in and
out of memory (MB/s) and the engine itself (a recursive
`fib`, a loop) on each backend that starts, to choose one. `--no-jit` takes the JIT off JavaScriptCore
(`JSC_useJIT=false`): where there is none, an interpreter such as `wasm3` can be several times faster.

Each count is that of the version the row was run on, and the self-test has grown since the older rows (it has 35 steps on
`wasmtime` and `wasm3` now, and 41 on the JavaScript engines); the times are one run of the self-test each, so read them as an order of magnitude. A host function costs about
what a call does, plus a round trip on `node` or `bun` (measured once: about 4 us on `wasm3`, 50 us on `wasmtime` and `jsc`,
200 us on `node`, per host call including the export around it).

Host functions and the C API bytes path on `jscontext` have run on both iOS apps above; on Linux they also run
against a fake `objc_util` whose `c` is the real JavaScriptCore library, and on macOS in CI against a real
Objective-C `JSContext` through rubicon-objc. Not run on a device: the `rubicon-objc` bridge (both iOS apps have
`objc_util`, so it isn't needed there). Node's synchronous wait for a host function's answer has run in CI on Linux,
macOS and Windows; Bun's, in CI on Linux and macOS (not on Windows yet).

### A note on wasmtime and `faulthandler`

wasmtime installs process-wide signal handlers when its first engine is created, and uses them to catch a trap.
Python's `faulthandler` (on with `python -X faulthandler`, and in pytest) replaces the handlers when it is enabled
*after* that, and the first trap then ends the process (`Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction`). Enable it first
(or not at all), or start the backend later: this repo's `tests/conftest.py` does that.

## Not yet

What the JavaScript API has, or a module can need, and wasmhost does not have yet. `BACKLOG.md` has the order in
which it is meant to be done.

- **Tables and references.** The signature of a table entry is not told by a JavaScript engine (set it by hand,
  or let the module's `elem` segment tell it; wasmtime finds it); no `externref` (tables, globals or values); no `v128`.
- **Memory is copied** on `read` and `write`. `Memory.view(offset, length)` gives the engine's own memory as a `memoryview`, with no copy, on `wasmtime` and `wasm3`
  (not on a JavaScript engine, whose memory lives in another place); it is released when the module may have run (a call, a batch, a `grow`), so it is
  for use at once. On a JavaScript engine the cost of moving a buffer is in the encoding, not the copy: see `wasmhost bench`.
- **Limits on untrusted code** are only partly possible: a memory ceiling everywhere, a timeout and a fuel count only where the
  engine can do it, and **none of the last two on iOS**. See "Limits for untrusted code" above.
- **Threads.** A module built with `-pthread` (the WebAssembly threads proposal: a `shared` memory that the module
  imports, atomic instructions, threads made by the host as several instances of the module on one memory) does not
  run: `Memory(..., shared=True)` raises `NotImplementedError`, so it can not be given as an import. Build without
  threads (`-pthread` off, for wasm-ld `--no-threads`). A wasm instance runs in one thread, and a backend takes one
  call at a time (a lock of its own, see "Async and threads").
- **Newer proposals**: no API for `WebAssembly.Tag` and `WebAssembly.Exception` (the self-test only reports which
  encodings of exceptions an engine takes), SIMD, `memory64`, multi-memory, GC types.
  Whether a module that uses them runs is up to the engine.
- **WASI** is provided for `wasi_snapshot_preview1` by `wasmhost.wasi.preview1` (see [WASI](#wasi)); not yet: sockets, and a safe open through
  `openat` (the check of a name and the open are two steps now). `examples/coreutils.py` uses it and `examples/wasmclang.py` uses it for the calls that are not about files; `wasi_sh.py` keeps a host of its own (a file system that is not a folder, pipes).

## Test

```bash
uv run pytest                            # every backend that starts here
uv run pytest --wasm-backend node        # one backend: it must start, or the run stops with an error
uv run pytest --wasm-backend bun         # needs `bun` on PATH
uv run pytest --wasm-backend wasmtime    # or wasm3, or jsc (needs the JavaScriptCore library)
uv run pytest --wasm-backend gi-jsc      # needs PyGObject: `uv sync --extra gi-jsc` after the packages above, or a system-site-packages venv (the CI job)
uv run pyright && uv run ruff check
node tests/pyodide_run.mjs pytest        # the suite inside Pyodide (see [Pyodide as a backend](#pyodide-as-a-backend))
